I have spent most of my programming time with C++, C#, C, Java, and a bit of Javascript. At the moment I am learning Python, Swift, and Typescript. There is so much potential with this degree that I have not yet figured out what I want to do with it once I have graduated. I am going to send an application to pretty much every organization and see what offers I have. I am a sucker for escape rooms and try to do any that I come across.',

My favorite breed of dog is West Highland Terrier, and I greatly look forward to taking lots of pictures of all sorts of dogs to test out the software we build in this project. My programming experence is mostly with C++ and Java, but I have developed projects with JavaScript as well. I am currently studying machine learning techniques using Python and a broad array of different libraries for Python. I hope this site serves as an educational tool that is both fun and engaging for users from all walks of life!',
